# REQPY: Spectral Matching of Earthquake Records

A Python module for spectral matching of earthquake records using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) based methodologies described in the referenced papers.

Its primary capabilities include:

* Matching a single ground motion component to a target spectrum.
* Matching a pair of horizontal components to an orientation-independent target spectrum RotDnn (e.g., RotD100).
* Analysis functions for generating standard and rotated (RotDnn) spectra.
* Baseline correction routines for processed time histories.
